graph TD
    A[Primary Compute Node] -->|44.0 TFLOPS| D[Neural Processing Unit]
    B[Auxiliary Compute Node] -->|10.6 TFLOPS| D
    D -->|MLX Optimized| E[AI Services Layer]
    E --> F[Blockchain Integration Layer]
```

#### Performance Specifications
- Primary Node: 44.0 TFLOPS
- Auxiliary Node: 10.6 TFLOPS
- Combined Performance: 87.0 TFLOPS
- Neural Processing: MLX optimization for AI workloads

### 2. Blockchain Integration Layer

The Solana integration provides real-time verification and indexing capabilities:

```typescript
class SolanaService {
    // Native web3.js integration
    connection = new Connection(rpcUrl);

    async capabilities() {
        return {
            walletAnalysis: true,
            nftTracking: true,
            transactionHistory: true,
            stateVerification: true
        };
    }
}
```

Key Features:
- Real-time transaction monitoring
- NFT collection analysis
- Wallet analytics engine
- State verification protocols

### 3. AI Services Integration

Multiple AI services work in concert to provide comprehensive analysis:

#### Text Generation Pipeline

- Social media monitoring
- On-chain data indexing
- Cross-reference verification

### 4. Control Interface

The React-based control interface provides comprehensive system management:

```typescript
interface CheshireStatus {
    llama: boolean;
    openai: boolean;
    firecrawl: boolean;
    twitter: boolean;
}

interface SystemMetrics {
    totalTflops: number;
    activeNodes: number;
    grinBalance: number;
}
```

Features:
- Real-time system monitoring
- Service status tracking
- Configuration management
